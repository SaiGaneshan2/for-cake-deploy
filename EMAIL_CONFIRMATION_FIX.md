# Supabase Email Confirmation Fix

## The Issue
Your Supabase project requires email confirmation, but during development this can be cumbersome.

## Quick Solutions:

### Option 1: Disable Email Confirmation (Easiest for Development)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Settings** 
3. Find **"Enable email confirmations"**
4. **Turn it OFF** for development
5. Save settings

### Option 2: Manually Confirm the User
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Find your user (`varsha.unique2025@gmail.com`)
3. Click on the user
4. Look for **"Email Confirmed"** field
5. Set it to **true** or check the confirmation box

### Option 3: Use the Enhanced Login Component
The updated `TeacherLogin.jsx` now includes:
- Better error messages for unconfirmed emails
- **"Resend Confirmation Email"** button that appears when you get the "Email not confirmed" error
- Clear instructions on what to do next

## Test Steps:
1. Try logging in with `varsha.unique2025@gmail.com`
2. If you get "Email not confirmed" error, click **"Resend Confirmation Email"**
3. Check your email inbox (and spam folder)
4. Click the confirmation link
5. Try logging in again

## For Production:
Keep email confirmation enabled for security, but for development you can disable it temporarily.

## Current Error Resolution:
The `AuthApiError: Email not confirmed` error is now properly handled with helpful UI guidance.
